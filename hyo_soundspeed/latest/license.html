<dt>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</dt>
<dd>Version 2.1, February 1999</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</dt>
<dd><p class="first">as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p class="last">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software&#8211;to
make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially</div></blockquote>
<p>designated software packages&#8211;typically libraries&#8211;of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but
we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the
ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any
particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div></blockquote>
<p>not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors</div></blockquote>
<p>to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or</div></blockquote>
<p>for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other
code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients,
so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We protect your rights with a two-step method:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>we copyright the library, and</li>
<li>we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.</li>
</ol>
<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and
passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version,
so that the original author&#8217;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might
be introduced by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.</div></blockquote>
<p>We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free
program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist
that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with
the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General</div></blockquote>
<p>Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.
We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries
into non-free programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library,</div></blockquote>
<p>the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the
original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We call this license the &#8220;Lesser&#8221; General Public License because it does Less to</div></blockquote>
<p>protect the user&#8217;s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides
other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest</div></blockquote>
<p>possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve
this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case,
there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use
the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables</div></blockquote>
<p>a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission
to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole
GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users&#8217; freedom,</div></blockquote>
<p>it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the
freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</div></blockquote>
<p>Pay close attention to the difference between a &#8220;work based on the library&#8221; and
a &#8220;work that uses the library&#8221;. The former contains code derived from the library,
whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
called &#8220;this License&#8221;). Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A &#8220;library&#8221; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as</div></blockquote>
<p>to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions
and data) to form executables.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The &#8220;Library&#8221;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been</div></blockquote>
<p>distributed under these terms. A &#8220;work based on the Library&#8221; means either the Library
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &#8220;modification&#8221;.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Source code&#8221; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making</div></blockquote>
<p>modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered</div></blockquote>
<p>by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library
does and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#8217;s complete source</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with
the Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may</div></blockquote>
<p>at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then
you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that</dt>
<dd>is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d
requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function
must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function
must still compute square roots.)</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.
But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with</div></blockquote>
<p>the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter
all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version
than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so</div></blockquote>
<p>the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative
works made from that copy.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into</div></blockquote>
<p>a program that is not a library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,</div></blockquote>
<p>then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies
the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &#8220;work that uses
the Library&#8221;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>However, linking a &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221; with the Library creates an executable</div></blockquote>
<p>that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather
than a &#8220;work that uses the library&#8221;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When a &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221; uses material from a header file that is part of</div></blockquote>
<p>the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even
though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for
this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and</div></blockquote>
<p>accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length),
then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally
a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object</div></blockquote>
<p>code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that
work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly
with the Library itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &#8220;work that</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>uses the Library&#8221; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,
and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer&#8217;s own use and reverse engineering
for debugging such modifications.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used</div></blockquote>
<p>in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply
a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you
must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha">

the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)</p>

<p>For an executable, the required form of the &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221; must include</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as
a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other</div></blockquote>
<p>proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction
means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side</li>

<p>in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based
on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that
you do these two things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient</li>

<p>automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or

restrictions on the recipients&#8217; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular</div></blockquote>
<p>circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is
intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property</div></blockquote>
<p>right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system
and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the
rest of this License.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="12">
<li>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either</li>

<p>by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
