HydrOffice is a research development environment for ocean mapping. It provides a collection of hydro-packages, each of them dealing with a specific issue of the field. The main goal is to speed up both algorithms testing and research-2-operation.

This package provides both a library and an application with functionalities to manage sound speed profiles, and
to provide pre-processing tools to help bridge the gap between sound speed profiling instrumentation and multibeam
echosounder acquisition systems.

It has been developing with the aim to merge together functionalities present in several applications that process sound
speed profiles (SSP) for underwater acoustic systems:

* *Velocipy*, an application originally developed at the `NOAA Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) <http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/>`_
  as part of the Pydro environment.

* *SVP Editor*, an application originally developed at the `Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (CCOM, UNH) <http://ccom.unh.edu/>`_
  for the MAC project (`Multibeam Advisory Committee <http://mac.unols.org/>`_)
  under the NSF grant 1150574.

* *SSP Manager*, an application developed at the `Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (CCOM, UNH) <http://ccom.unh.edu/>`_
  as part of the HydrOffice framework.

In the integration of all these implementations to the current hydro-package several improvements have been
introduced to enhance code maintainability, as well as to also to support Python 3 (from the original Python 2 only
implementation) and to store the collected data for further processing and analysis.


Operation modes
===============

.. index::
   single: mode; operation

Currently, the hydro-package can operate in two mutually exclusive operation modes:

1.	*Operator Mode*
2.	*Server Mode*

The :ref:`operator_mode` represents the primary mode, and it is used to convert data from different source formats,
to graphically edit them, and to export/send the resulting profiles for use by underwater acoustic systems.
Optional steps are the augmentation with measurements from a reference cast (to either improve salinity modeling
or extrapolate the cast to the required depth), either manually specifiying a loaded profile as reference cast,
or deriving the reference from oceanographic models (currently, WOA09 and RTOFS) as described
in :ref:`app_a_oceanographic_atlases`.

The :ref:`server_mode` was developed to deliver WOA/RTOFS-derived synthetic SSPs to one or more network clients in
a continuous manner, enabling opportunistic mapping while underway. Given the uncertainty of such an approach,
this mode is expected to only be used in transit, capturing the current position and using it as input to lookup
into the selected oceanographic model.
