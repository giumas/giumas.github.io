Detect fliers
-------------

.. index::
    single: fliers

How To Use?
^^^^^^^^^^^    
    
Scan grids for anomalous grid data "fliers".

* Select the **Detect fliers** tab on the bottom of the QC Tools interface.

.. index::
    single: fliers; height

* In **Parameters**, enter the **Flier height** in meters.

.. index::
    single: find fliers

* In **Execution**, click **Find fliers v1** or **Find fliers v2** (note, these use the same algorithm and one
  may expect the same output, only v2 has been optimized for faster operation, and v1 is expected to be deprecated
  after additional testing).

* After computing, the output window opens automatically, and the results are shown:

.. index::
    single: drag-and-drop

* From the output window, drag-and-drop the output into the processing software to guide the review.

How Does It Work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The grid is scanned, and any rise and fall pairings (for a shoal flier) or fall and rise pairings (for a deep flier) that both exceed the flier height parameter and that occur over a horizontal distance of 3 grid nodes will be flagged as a potential flier. 

In other words, to register as a potential flier, there are three requirements:

#. A depth change exceeding the flier height parameter.

#. A depth change in the opposite direction as the first, also exceeding the flier height parameter.

#. #1 and #2 must occur within 3 grid nodes horizontally. 

To illustrate the requirements are four examples:

* In the below example, no flier is registered because there is no fall to pair with the rise.

* In the below example, no flier is registered because the fall does not occur within 3 grid nodes of the rise.

* In the below example, no flier is registered because the rise and fall pairing does not exceed the flier height parameter.

* In the below example, a flier is registered because the rise and fall pairings exceed the flier height parameter and occur within 3 grid nodes.
