Detect fliers
-------------

.. index::
    single: fliers

Scan grids for anomalous grid data "fliers".

* Select the **Detect fliers** tab on the bottom of the QC Tools interface.

.. index::
    single: fliers; height

* In **Parameters**, enter the **Flier height** in meters.

.. index::
    single: find fliers

* In **Execution**, select **Find fliers v1** or **Find fliers v2** (note, these use the same algorithm and one
  may expect the same output, only v2 has been optimized for faster operation, and v1 is expected to be deprecated
  after additional testing).

* After computing, the output window opens automatically, and the results are shown:
