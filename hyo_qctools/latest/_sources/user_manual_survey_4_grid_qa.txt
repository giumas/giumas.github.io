How To Use?
^^^^^^^^^^^    
    
Computes grid statistics to ensure compliance to uncertainty and density requirements.

* Select the **Grid QA** tab on the bottom of the QC Tools interface.

.. index::
    single: grid qa; coverage

* In **Parameters**, check the box to calculate the TVU QC layer regardless of whether or not the grid contains the layer already.


.. index::
    single: grid, uncertainty, density

* In **Execution**, click **Grid QA v1**.

How Does It Work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Depth, Uncertainty, Density (if available), and a computed Total Vertical Uncertainty (TVU) QC layer (optional) are used to compute particular statistics shown as a series of plots.  

The TVU QC is either given to the program in the grid input, or calculated on-the-fly. It is determined by a ratio of uncertainty to allowable error per NOAA and IHO specification:

TVU QC = Uncertainty / (A^2 + ((B * Depth)^2))^.5

where A = 0.5, B = 0.013 for Order 1 (depths less than 100 m), and A = 1.0, B = 0.023 for Order 2 (depths greater than 100 m).

The following plots are the output of Grid QA:

* The Depth layer is plotted as a distribution (plot entitled "Depth Distribution").

* The Density layer is plotted as a distribution (plot entitled "Object Detection Coverage"). 

	* Percentages of nodes less than 5 soundings per node fall in the red shaded region of the plot and together must be less than 5% of all nodes in order to "pass".

* Density is plotted against the corresponding Depth of the node (plot entitled "Node Depth vs. Sounding Density").

* TVU QC is plotted as a distribution (plot entitled "Uncertainty Standards"). 

	* Percentages of nodes with TVU QC greater than 1.0 (indicating that the allowable error has been exceeded) fall in the red shaded region of the plot, and together must be less than 5% of all nodes in order to "pass".

* TVU QC is plotted against the corresponding Depth of the node (plot entitled "Node Depth vs. TVU QC").
