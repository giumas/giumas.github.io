In brief
===========

QC Tools assist in the review of various types of data occurring all throughout the ping-to-chart process. Data is input as a bathymetric grid and/or feature file, and the output is a GIS-layer that alerts to the user various parts of their data that might require more attention. 

The objectives are to improve data accuracy, while also reducing the overall time required for ping-to-chart.
