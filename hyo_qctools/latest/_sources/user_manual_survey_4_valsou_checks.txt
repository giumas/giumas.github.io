    single: VALSOU checks

* In **Parameters**:

	# Turn the knob to select the applicable year as pertaining to required Hydrographic Survey Specifications.
	# Enter in the applicable survey scale (e.g. 10,000 or 20,000, etc.).

* After computing, the output window opens automatically, and the results are shown (note, the check considers all
  combination of grids and features files loaded. If there is no overlap found between a grid and feature file,
  no output is generated, and the summary will report "no overlap"):
