How to use
=============

Survey Review
-------------

The Survey Review tab will ingest bathymetric grids and feature files. The grid will be scanned for anomalous grid data "fliers". The features will also be scanned to ensure proper attribution. Other functionalities (coming soon) include a parity check to ensure surveyed features are properly accounted for in the grid, and also the ability to export bottom samples to a text file for archival.

Data inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~

With the Survey Review tab selected on top of the interface, drag-and-drop any number of grids and/or features files anywhere onto the interface. The browse button may also be used (+). 

The directory and filename of accepted grid and feature files will populate in the respective locations of Data inputs. 

With the addition of a grid and features, the Detect fliers and Scan features tabs on the bottom of the interface are now available:

Note that any unaccepted file types will be rejected with a message to inform the user:

The Clear data button may be used to remove all data inputs.

After loading data, the ensuing functions (Detect fliers and Feature scan) will open the Output folder automatically upon execution;  however, if needed, this folder may be accessed by clicking the Output folder button in Data outputs.

Detect fliers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the Detect fliers tab on the bottom of the interface. In Parameters, enter in the Flier height in meters. In Execution, select Find fliers. The user may choose to use Find fliers v1 or Find fliers v2*. 

*Note that the algorithm and output are the same for v1 and v2, only v2 has been optimized for faster operation. v1 is expected to be deprecated after additional testing.

After computing, the output window opens automatically, and the results are shown:

From the output window, drag-and-drop the output into the processing software to guide the review.

Scan features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the Scan features tab on the bottom of the interface. In Parameters, turn the knob to select either the Office or Field profile. Click Feature scan v2.

After computing, the output window opens automatically, and the results are shown:

From the output window, drag-and-drop the output into the processing software to guide the review.

Chart Review
------------

The Chart Review tab will ingest a bathymetric grid and truncate the values to decimetric precision. Other functionalities (coming soon) will include evaluation of chart-scale soundings versus survey-scale soundings via "triangle rule", and feature scanning to ensure proper attribution.

Data inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~

With the Chart Review tab selected on top of the interface, drag-and-drop any number of grids (.bag only) anywhere onto the interface. The browse button may also be used (+). The directory and filename of accepted grids will populate in the Data inputs. Note that, with grid data loaded, the BAG truncate tab on the bottom of the interface is now available:

.. image:: _static/chart.png
    :alt: logo

The Clear data button may be used to remove all data inputs.

After loading data, the ensuing function (BAG truncate) will open the Output folder automatically upon execution;  however, if needed, this folder may be accessed by clicking the Output folder button in Data outputs.

BAG truncate
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click BAG Truncate v1.

After computing, the output window opens automatically, and the truncated BAGs are ready to use for chart compilation.
